== Documentation & Release Notes
Documentation is a vital part of the development stage. Your development team must strictly follow MuleSoft documentation standards described in this document.

=== Built-in Documentation

Part of the documentation must be packed within the connector source code. The mandatory files are:

. User Guide
. Release Notes
. ReadMe

In addition, create an extra folder named _images_ inside the _doc_ folder. This resource folder contains any resources (images, XMLs, etc.) used in the documentation.

==== User Guide

The user guide needs to be fully descriptive and easy to read, including not only technical documentation but use cases and error solutions. Write the documentation using AsciiDoc syntax so that the resulting file is called _user_manual.adoc_. A template can be found link:files/user-manual.adoc[here].
It should reside in _doc_ folder in the root of the connector project.


==== Release Notes

Release notes need to be highly descriptive, including backward compatibility of the released connector with previous versions. A template can be found link:files/release-notes.adoc[here].
It should reside in _doc_ folder in the root of the connector project.

==== ReadMe

A README.md template can be found link:files/README.md[here]. It should reside in the root of the connector project.

=== Connector ApiDocs

Each public connector requires:

. A description that provides a clear and a complete explanation of its purpose.
. An XML sample that is up-to-date with the method signature and can be directly pasted into Anypointâ„¢ Studio.
. Attributes that affect methods behavior documented in detail.
